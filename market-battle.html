    <h1>Amazon vs AliExpress: Who Wins the Gadget Game?</h1>

    <div style="text-align:left; max-width:700px; margin: 2rem auto; line-height:1.6;">
      <p>The battle for gadget supremacy is fierce. Here’s how Amazon and AliExpress stack up:</p>

      <h2>Price</h2>
      <p>AliExpress usually offers lower prices due to direct-from-manufacturer sales, but Amazon’s deals and Prime discounts make it competitive.</p>

      <h2>Delivery Speed</h2>
      <p>Amazon dominates with fast and reliable shipping, often within days. AliExpress can take weeks, depending on location.</p>

      <h2>Product Quality</h2>
      <p>Amazon tends to have more consistent quality control, while AliExpress has a wider variety with variable standards.</p>

      <h2>User Experience</h2>
      <p>Amazon’s interface and customer service are top-notch. AliExpress’s platform is improving but can be less intuitive.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>For speed and reliability, Amazon is the winner. For budget-conscious shoppers willing to wait, AliExpress offers great deals.</p>
